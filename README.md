Quick-n-dirty repo to preprocess CORD-19 data to format it for rhapsode.

See search application here: http://162.242.228.174:8092/rhapsode/basic/

As is immediately obvious, the application was not built by an UI designer, 
but rather only to prove the capabilities of concordance and cooccurrence search
along with some other capabilities.  See also LUCENE-5205...

The source code for the search application is here: https://github.com/tballison/rhapsode
